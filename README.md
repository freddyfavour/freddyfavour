# Favour Alfredâœ¨

I'm a **Frontend Developer** who believes great software should feel as smooth as it looks. I build **performance-first web interfaces** using **React**, with a focus on **clean UI, intuitive UX**, and scalable architecture. Whether it's a Chrome extension, a Discord bot, or a data-driven dashboard, Iâ€™m all about solving real problems with code.

Iâ€™ve contributed to open-source, led community learning sessions, and even built tools that help people in unexpected ways (like scanning Nigerian plate numbers or teaching AI in plain English). Tech has introduced me to brilliant minds from all over the worldâ€”and Iâ€™m just getting started.

ðŸ”§ Currently exploring: **Full-Stack Development, and Marketing strategies.**  
ðŸŽ¯ Mission: Ship products that spark **"wow, that was smooth!"** moments.

Letâ€™s build something that matters.
