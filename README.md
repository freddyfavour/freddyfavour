# 👋 Hi, I'm Favour Alfred

### 🚀 Frontend Developer · Builder · Vision-Driven Technologist

I craft smooth, performance-first web experiences using **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and other modern tools. My focus? Building user interfaces that **load fast**, **look clean**, and **feel intuitive** — the kind that spark a subtle “whoa” when you use them.

From AI-driven tools and animation showcases to Chrome extensions and community experiments, I’m constantly learning by building.

### 💡 What I Do
- 🧠 Build responsive, scalable UIs with **React**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind**
- 🔌 Integrate APIs and AI like **Gemini**, **Firebase**, and **TMDB**
- ✍🏾 Simplify complex concepts — from AI to legal jargon — into real tools
- 👥 Collaborate in teams (like **TEDxAdo-Ekiti 2025**) to bring products to life

### 🎯 Mission
Ship products that feel **buttery smooth**, solve real problems, and inspire people to say:  
> “Wait — you built that?”
